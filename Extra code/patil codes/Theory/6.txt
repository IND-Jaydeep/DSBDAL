NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER

------------------------------------------------------------
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classification algorithm 
based on applying **Bayes' Theorem** with the **naive assumption** 
that the features (input variables) are **independent** given the class.

It’s widely used for:
- Text classification (e.g., spam filtering)
- Sentiment analysis
- Document classification

------------------------------------------------------------
### Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of a class (label) given the features. 
It is expressed as:

    P(C|X) = (P(X|C) * P(C)) / P(X)

Where:
- **P(C|X)** = The probability of class **C** given features **X** (posterior probability).
- **P(X|C)** = The likelihood, or probability of features **X** given class **C**.
- **P(C)** = The prior probability of class **C**.
- **P(X)** = The probability of features **X** (also known as the marginal likelihood).

### Naive Assumption:

The "naive" part of the algorithm assumes that all features (X) are **independent** given the class (C). This simplifies the computation of the likelihood P(X|C), which would otherwise be computationally expensive.

    P(X|C) = P(X1|C) * P(X2|C) * ... * P(Xn|C)

This is an unrealistic assumption in many real-world applications, but it works surprisingly well for many problems!

------------------------------------------------------------
### Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers:

There are three common types of Naive Bayes classifiers based on the type of features:

1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes (for continuous data):**
   - Assumes that the features follow a **Gaussian (normal) distribution**.
   - Used when the input features are continuous values, such as height, weight, etc.

2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes (for discrete data):**
   - Commonly used for **text classification** where the features are word frequencies or word counts.
   - Assumes that features (e.g., word counts in a document) follow a **multinomial distribution**.

3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes (for binary data):**
   - Used when the features are binary (0 or 1).
   - It works by assuming that each feature follows a **Bernoulli distribution**.

------------------------------------------------------------
### Naive Bayes Steps:

#### Step 1: **Prior Probability (P(C))**
   - First, calculate the prior probability of each class. This is the proportion of each class in the dataset.
   - Example:
     P(Class 1) = Number of instances of Class 1 / Total number of instances

#### Step 2: **Likelihood (P(X|C))**
   - Calculate the likelihood of each feature (given the class).
   - For example, if we're predicting spam or not, we'd calculate the likelihood of the word "free" occurring given that the message is **spam** or **not spam**.

#### Step 3: **Posterior Probability (P(C|X))**
   - For each class, apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which tells us the probability of a class given the input features.

#### Step 4: **Classification**
   - The class with the highest posterior probability is chosen as the predicted class.

### Naive Bayes Formula for Classification:

For a given class **C** and feature vector **X = {X1, X2, ..., Xn}**, we compute:

    P(C|X) = (P(C) * P(X1|C) * P(X2|C) * ... * P(Xn|C)) / P(X)

Where:
- **P(C)** = Prior probability of class **C**.
- **P(X1|C), P(X2|C), ..., P(Xn|C)** = Likelihood of each feature (X) given the class.
- **P(X)** = Normalizing constant (which is the same for all classes, so we ignore it for classification).

We predict the class **C** that maximizes **P(C|X)**.

------------------------------------------------------------
### Example:

Let's consider a simple example where we are classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on the presence of two words: "free" and "money".

#### Data:
- P(spam) = 0.4
- P(not spam) = 0.6
- P(free|spam) = 0.7
- P(free|not spam) = 0.2
- P(money|spam) = 0.6
- P(money|not spam) = 0.1

Given an email with "free" and "money", we calculate the posterior probabilities:

    P(spam|free, money) = P(spam) * P(free|spam) * P(money|spam)
                         = 0.4 * 0.7 * 0.6

    P(not spam|free, money) = P(not spam) * P(free|not spam) * P(money|not spam)
                             = 0.6 * 0.2 * 0.1

We then compare the probabilities and predict the class with the higher posterior probability.

### Pros and Cons of Naive Bayes:

#### **Pros:**
- **Simple** and easy to implement.
- **Fast** to train, even on large datasets.
- Performs well even with **high-dimensional data** (e.g., text data with a large vocabulary).
- Requires **less training data** compared to other models.

#### **Cons:**
- The **naive assumption** (features are independent) is often unrealistic, which can lead to **lower accuracy**.
- It **can't model complex relationships** between features.

------------------------------------------------------------
### When to Use Naive Bayes:

Naive Bayes is particularly useful when:
- You have **text classification tasks**, such as email spam detection, sentiment analysis, or document categorization.
- The **features are conditionally independent**, or you don’t mind the simplification.
- You want a **fast, efficient** algorithm that works well with **large datasets**.

What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for 
classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an 
instance belongs to a given class or not. Logistic regression is a statistical 
algorithm which analyze the relationship between two data factors. The article 
explores the fundamentals of logistic regression, it‚Äôs types and implementations.


Understanding Sigmoid Function
So far, we‚Äôve covered the basics of logistic regression, but now let‚Äôs focus on 
the most important function that forms the core of logistic regression.

The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map the predicted values
 to probabilities.
It maps any real value into another value within a range of 0 and 1. The value
 of the logistic regression must be between 0 and 1, which cannot go beyond this limit, so it forms a curve like the ‚ÄúS‚Äù form.
The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.
In logistic regression, we use the concept of the threshold value, which
 defines the probability of either 0 or 1. Such as values above the threshold value tends to 1, and a value below the threshold values tends to 0.

EVALUATING LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

----------------------------------------------------
Evaluating the model helps us assess the model‚Äôs performance 
and ensure it generalizes well to new data.

We can evaluate the logistic regression model using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy:**
   - Accuracy provides the proportion of correctly classified instances.
   - Formula:
     Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total

2. **Precision:**
   - Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions.
   - Formula:
     Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

3. **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):**
   - Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all actual positive instances.
   - Formula:
     Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

4. **F1 Score:**
   - F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - Formula:
     F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

5. **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC):**
   - The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds.
   - AUC-ROC measures the area under this curve, providing an aggregate measure of a model‚Äôs performance across different classification thresholds.

6. **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR):**
   - Similar to AUC-ROC, AUC-PR measures the area under the precision-recall curve, providing a summary of a model‚Äôs performance across different precision-recall trade-offs.
